# NOT_A_VIRUS #

simple python virus... it will copy it self over and over again 

DONT RUN ON YOUR MACHINE, TEST IT ON TO A VM  

it was created for windows machines but you can run it on to a linux with the .py file...

the only way to stop it is to kill it from CMD

perfect for school computers that allow exe and or computers that have python installed on to them.
